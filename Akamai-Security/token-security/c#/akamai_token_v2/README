CONTENTS

This archive contains the following:
    A C# library for generating EdgeAuth Tokens

OVERVIEW:
This library is accessible as a exe that can also be referenced in another projects.

LIBRARY USAGE:
Add a reference to the TokenAuth C# project or directly reference the TokenAuth.exe file obtained after compiling this project.

You first create an instance of the AkamaiTokenConfig class, then assign the properties specific to your configuration

/** Begin sample code **/
using com.Akamai.EdgeAuth;

		conf.Key = "ab09";									// At a minimum, your configuration specific key value needs to be set.
			
		// After setting all properties relevant to your delivery configuration, all the GenerateToken method
		String token = AkamaiTokenGenerator.GenerateToken(conf);
		
		// print the token...
		Console.WriteLine(token);
		// which looks like st=1344453527~exp=1344453827~acl=%2Fz%2F%2a~hmac=77c55a13b45f06ae5ac1d6ee61dc78cfc4ec3f97f73753725e5ec30069e0833d
	}
